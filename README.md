CryptoTracker is a simple web app created to help develop my understanding of Asynchronous Programming, and FetchAPI.

Using Coin Gecko's API, I was able to create a tool that returns information on the searched coin. The app loops through an array of coins generated by Coin Gecko's API, and uses information therewithin to Fetch up to date pricing information.

The prototype is pretty good to look at if I don't say so myself! It's fully responsive although effects are to be added soon.

To come:

- Add media queries and finalise UI 
- Add top20 panel
- local storage
- More??

Built using vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, chart.js, moment.js
